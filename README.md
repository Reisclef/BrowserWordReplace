# BrowserWordReplace

For anyone who wants a lighter kind of newsreading.

## Origins

I was originally inspired to create this by Last Week Tonight's [Drumpfinator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drumpfinator/hcimhbfpiofdihhdnofbdlhjcmjopilp)  

The main problems I had with it were that:

- I had no idea what code was running behind it
- It only replaced certain words

Therefore, I decided to create a simple Chrome Extension to allow a user to find and replace whatever words they might want. Furthermore, I decided to open-source the project in order to keep it transparent so anyone could see the code.

## Example

For example if you replace "Brexit" with "Breakfast" (as a few politicians have inadvertantly done), you get gems such as:

[Breakfast could leave Britain with a bare larder, farmers warn](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/05/brexit-could-leave-britain-with-a-bare-larder-farmers-warn)
